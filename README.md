## âœ¨Coursework & Personal Projectsâœ¨
### 1. [Master of Data Science, Durham University, United Kingdom](https://github.com/JiraLeelas/Durham-Data-Science)
A showcase of a selection of coursework and projects submitted for the Master of Data Science degree in the 2023 to 2024 academic year. 
The program includes Introduction to Statistics for Data Science, Programming for Data Science, Text Mining and Language Analytics, and Data Exploration, Visualization, and Unsupervised Learning.

### 2. Master's Project: Data Extraction and Analysis Ecosystem for High-throughput Thermal Gradient Experiments
A proof-of-concept project for high-throughput, parallel analysis of material thermal property changes under a controlled gradient heating and cooling system. This project involves a data extraction library to extract temperature profiles from HIKMICRO Pocket 2 radiometric thermography and a visualization and analytic dashboard built using the Plotly Dash Python framework. 
- 2.1 [Meltyfat](https://github.com/JiraLeelas/meltyfat): A Radiometric Thermography Data Extraction Package
- 2.2 [Interactive Visualization and Analysis Dashboard](https://github.com/JiraLeelas/hik-thermo-dashboard)

### 3. [Portuguese Bank Term Deposit Subscription Prediction](https://github.com/JiraLeelas/Bank-Term-Deposit-Prediction)
A personal project analyzing a Portuguese bank's telemarketing campaign for term deposit subscriptions using the UCI Machine Learning dataset. 
We investigate key trends among subscribed clients compared to the overall customer base. 
This project aims to help marketers identify potential clients based on historical data through statistical learning models, improving targeting strategies and campaign effectiveness.
